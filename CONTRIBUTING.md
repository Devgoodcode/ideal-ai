# Contributing to Ideal-AI

🚀 **Welcome to the "One Connector" Project.**

Our mission is bold but simple: **Build the single, universal interface for ALL Artificial Intelligence.**

We want this tool to empower **everyone**:
* **Beginners & Students:** To learn and experiment easily.
* **Researchers:** To test models without friction.
* **Developers & Specialists:** To build robust production agents.

**We don't want to restrict you.** We want this connector to handle *everything* and help *everyone*.

### 🌟 Where you can have a massive impact:

1.  **Add New Superpowers (Modalities):**
    * We have Video and Audio... what about **3D generation**? **Music generation**? **Robot control**?
    * If an API exists, we want it in `ideal-ai`.

2.  **Democratize & Educate:**
    * Create simple examples (Notebooks) for beginners.
    * Improve documentation to make complex AI concepts accessible.
    * Make error messages helpful for students.

3.  **Add New Providers:**
    * Found a cool new model (Mistral, Cohere, local LLMs)? Add it to `config.json`.
    * Make the connector compatible with *any* API on the planet.

4.  **Improve the Core:**
    * Make it faster, smarter, and production-ready for specialists.

### 🛠 How to propose a change
1.  **Fork** the project.
2.  **Hack it.** Break limits. Add that feature you always wanted.
3.  Open a **Pull Request** and tell us: *"Look what I enabled!"*

**There are no small contributions.** Whether it's a typo fix, a tutorial for students, or a new architecture for pros, join the movement.
